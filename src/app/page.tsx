                <li className="">Classic mode is perfect for testing the game and getting a feel for the mechanics. Scores are not tracked, and gameplay doesn’t affect the leaderboards. Plus, you’ll have access to helpful features like skipping a challenge if you get stuck.</li>
                <li className="">In leaderboard mode, your scores matter! Enter a username that persists across sessions, and any new high scores will be saved to your account and displayed on the leaderboards. However, be prepared for a challenge—skipping isn’t allowed!</li>
